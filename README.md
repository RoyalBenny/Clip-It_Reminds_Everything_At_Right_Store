ClipIt is a real-time navigation software which help to re-collect memories. We mainly focus on informing the user what are the listed items to buy when user are near to the proposed  shops . No need to choose the name of a shop, only select the type of item to buy (medicine, grocery item, ATMs, gas stations...)  and required place. ClipIt also work in offline except selecting locations. User can also specify the shop, so that Clip-It will notify user only when he reach near to the specified shop. 

For example,
        A person should needs to buy some grocery items, because of job stress he forgot it. We design ClipIt to solve this problem. When a user reaches nearby any grocery shops on respective location it will automatically notify the user to buy the listed items. This is only one of the example, user can do much more in this app. The user can select any category like pharmacy, grocery, restaurant, other shops etc....
